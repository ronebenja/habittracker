This document contains our user class. The user class contains all the important functions of our programme.
Since our programme can create and manage several users, all functions always refer to the logged-in user.
This code part contains functions to manage the user profile, to create and manage user specific habits and
all functions around analysis.

It imports the libraries questionary, sqlite, datetime and hashlib.
It further imports the Habit.py document to be able to use the HabitClass.

        """
        Computes the longest streak of a habit with the periodicity weekly.

        Pulls all progress data from the database, stores and cleans the data in a list. Subtracts the values from each
        other. The differences are saved in a new list.
        The streak is calculated and the maximum streak count is returned.

        Parameters
        ----------
        :param habit_name: str
            Is assigned through the functions longest_streak_habit() and longest_streak_overview()

        Returns
        -------
        :return: int
             Returns a number from 0 to infinite (max_value) as the longest streak count.
